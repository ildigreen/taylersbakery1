This is an empty folder for you to submit your Web Dev Project in.

You must submit all the code and assets that are required to run your website. If there are additional steps needed to run your website, e.g. running a script, please include a note of this somewhere in your repository.

**Only code pushed to your GitHub repository before the assessment deadline will be marked. Ensure you give yourself enough time before your final push.**

## The Brief
Often, web developers are approached by companies, individuals, charities, and organisations asking them to create a specific website or web experience. It comes down to the developer not only to program the website, but also to design or implement key aspects when the client may not have the skillset to do so themselves. 

For this assessment, you must pick one of the client briefs available on Minerva, and implement the website they have asked for. Your website must:

* Deploy HTML5 and semantic elements.
* Deploy CSS to style the pages.
* Include at least 3 pages. The user should be able navigate between them using hyperlinks.
* Include rich media (e.g. images, video, audio, etc).
* Be well indented, be well formatted, and contain helpful code comments.

Each brief also has an “Additional Requirement”, that asks you to design or implement some other aspect of their website. For example, you may need to implement a database, or create a compelling visual design. To do this successfully, you may need to use skills you have learned in other modules. If you are unsure which client brief you should pick, you should discuss this with your tutor.

You may optionally use JavaScript, Python, SQL, or any other related technologies to implement your website.

Alongside your web development project, you will submit a 1,000-2,000 development document, where you will discuss the technical implementation of a web project and reflect critically on the results.
